This is a small utility to control an army in GURPS-based settings.

Current translation status - finished and not started (but feel free to ask custom translations)

Main controls - toolbar with buttons (+) (-) (Upd) (Save)
 (+) need to add a new value in current view
 (-) removes an selected value\values
 (Upd) reloads data from DB
 (Save) need to save squad movings between armys.

DB - main database stored in 'db' folder at place, where main.exe launched. Its used simple sqlite model, and if you need you can modify it with any sql compatible software
 !!!IMPORTANT please, periodically make a DB backup

Source and Modifications
 Source code, written on python 2.7 stored at GitHub https://github.com/llan0war/ArmyBuilder
 Feel free to request changes, report bugs and so on
 If you want to launch ArmyBuilder from source code, you need python 2.7, PyQt 4.8, SQLAlchemy 0.9.1 and Elixir 0.7.1, but remember make changes in alchemy as described there http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14201210/impossible-to-initialize-elixir
 Also you can change an UI, both interface and dialogs stored in 'interface' folder. You can use QTDesigner to modify *.ui files and use interface_gen.cmd to convert it into .py classes
 And please - don't say me that my code is scaring, i'm know, its first time i'm using alchemy+qt

Compiling
 Assembling project to *.exe really simple, you need install py2exe and run 'pytnon -u setup.py py2exe'. Result will be stored at 'dist' folder
